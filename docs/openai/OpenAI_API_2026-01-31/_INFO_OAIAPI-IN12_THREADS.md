# INFO: OpenAI API - Threads

**Doc ID**: OAIAPI-IN12
**Goal**: Document Threads API endpoints
**Version scope**: API v1, Documentation date 2026-01-30

**Depends on:**
- `_INFO_OAIAPI-IN11_ASSISTANTS.md [OAIAPI-IN21]` for context

## Summary

Threads represent conversations in the Assistants API. Each thread maintains a persistent message history that can be continued across multiple runs. Threads are created independently and then associated with assistants during run creation. They can include tool resources like vector stores for file search within the conversation context. Threads persist until explicitly deleted and can contain unlimited messages.

## Key Facts

- **Persistence**: Until explicitly deleted [VERIFIED]
- **Messages**: Unlimited per thread [VERIFIED]
- **Tool resources**: Vector stores for file search [VERIFIED]
