Verify against the spec requirements and the existing code. Look for bugs, inconsistencies, contradictions, ambiguities, underspeced behavior. Think of corner cases we haven't covered yet. Ensure we have a detailed changes / additions plan. Ensure we have en exhausting implementation verification checklist at the end.

At the end, make sure the spec meets the rules outlined in implementation-specification-rules.md.
