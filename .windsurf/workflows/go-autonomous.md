Do we have enough context for autonomous activity?
- Are we in a A) single task conversation or B) multiple threads?
- Do we have stop or acceptance criteria?

If unclear, ask for clarification.

Then re-read the previous conversation, provided and relevant files. Make an internal MUST-NOT-FORGET list and review / edit it after each step.

Then map out all neessary steps.
Keep the steps small to ensure high quality.
Use progress tracking and note taking tools.

Then enter an autonomous loop.
Work though each step.
Use frequent and small commits.
Run the /verify.md workflow after each step.

After reaching the goal, verify again against MUST-NOT-FORGET list.
Do a final commit if necessary.
