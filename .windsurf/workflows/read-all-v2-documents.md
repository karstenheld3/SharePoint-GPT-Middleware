Make sure you have no duplicates in your read list.
Find all .md files in the workspace but ONLY in the /.windsurf/rules folder and all subfolders.
Read these files.

Then read:
- /src: app.py, logging_v2.py, utils.py, hardcoded_config.py, common_sharepoint_functions.py, common_openai_functions.py
- /: _V2_SPEC_JOBS_UI.md, _V2_SPEC_ROUTERS.md, SOPS.md

Return only a single line: "Read [x] md files, [z]k context tokens"
