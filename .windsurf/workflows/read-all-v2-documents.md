Make sure you have no duplicates in your read list.
Find all .md files in the workspace but ONLY in the /.windsurf/rules folder and all subfolders.
Read these files.

Then read:
- /: SOPS.md, _V2_SPEC_ROUTERS.md, _V2_SPEC_DEMOROUTER_UI.md, _V2_SPEC_COMMON_UI_FUNCTIONS.md
- /src/: app.py, common_utility_functions.py, hardcoded_config.py
- /src/routers_v2/: demorouter2.py, jobs.py, common_job_functions_v2.py, common_logging_functions_v2.py

Return only a single line: "Read [x] md files, [y] code files, [z]k context tokens"
