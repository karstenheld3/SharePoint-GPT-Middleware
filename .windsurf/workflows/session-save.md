## Required Skills

Invoke these skills before proceeding:
- @session-management for session file structure
- @git-conventions for commit format

Re-read the entire conversation and find:
- New problems found -> to be documented in session PROBLEMS.md
- Important findings -> to be documented in session NOTES.md
- Things that did work and things that didn't -> to be documented in session PROGRESS.md
- Be very careful to NOT document assumptions that are not verified.
- Wait until tests and pocs prove what is working and what not.
- Use [TESTED] and [ASSUMED] markers

Compare all changes since the last commit and summarize.
 -> to be documented in session PROGRESS.md

Update all session files.
Then run commit.md workflow.
