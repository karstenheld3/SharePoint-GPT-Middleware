Make a research plan and do a step by step research about the user topic, adding sections step by step to the information document. After each section ask yourself: Do I have to verify these findings with further research? Can I remove duplicates? Can I remove unverified and contradicting findings? Is this information really helpful? If yes, why?

Always review the new section in the context of the existing ones to remove cognitive overload, redundancies, ambiguities, unverified findings.

If the research results suggest that there is no verified solution to a problem, think outside of the box: Are missing important points to see the problem or task from a different perspective? Are there clever alternatives that we are overlooking? Just don't be a super smart moron, polluting our information document with stupid and irrelevant research or non-working solutions.

At the end of the document, list all read sources with URL and the primary findings.
At the top of the document, summarize the findings as a copy / paste ready list.
