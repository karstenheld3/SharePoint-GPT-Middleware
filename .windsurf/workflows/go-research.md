# Go Research Workflow

SOLVE workflow (RESEARCH type) following EDIRD phases.

## Required Skills

Invoke these skills before proceeding:
- @write-documents for INFO document structure

## EDIRD Cycle (SOLVE: RESEARCH)

### EXPLORE
1. [ASSESS] → RESEARCH type confirmed
2. [SCOPE] what question to answer
3. [PLAN] research approach

### DESIGN
1. [OUTLINE] INFO document structure
2. [DEFINE] what constitutes verified finding

### IMPLEMENT
1. [RESEARCH] step by step, adding sections to INFO document
2. After each section, ask yourself:
   - Do I need to verify these findings with further research?
   - Can I remove duplicates and contradicting findings?
   - Is this information really helpful? If yes, why?
3. [SYNTHESIZE] findings into coherent understanding

### REFINE
1. [REVIEW] each section in context of existing ones
2. [VERIFY] claims against sources - remove unverified findings (run `/verify`)
3. [IMPROVE] remove cognitive overload, redundancies, ambiguities

### DELIVER
1. [SUMMARIZE] at top - copy/paste ready findings
2. [CONCLUDE] with recommendations
3. List all sources with URL and primary findings

## Rules

- **Source Retention Rule:** ALL sources (web URLs, PDFs, documents, code files) must be kept in the research output. Never discard sources - even if findings were minimal or contradictory, document what was checked to avoid re-checking.
- Think outside of the box if no verified solution exists: Are missing important points to see the problem or task from a different perspective? Are there clever alternatives that we are overlooking? 
- Don't pollute with irrelevant or non-working solutions, just don't be a super smart moron.
