## Required Rules and Skills

Read these before proceeding:
- `[AGENT_FOLDER]/rules/research-and-report-writing-rules.md` for MEPI/MCPI research depth
- @write-documents for INFO document structure

## MUST-NOT-FORGET

- **Summary section is mandatory** - Copy/paste ready list at document top
- **Label ALL findings** with verification status:
  - `[ASSUMED]` - Unverified, needs validation
  - `[VERIFIED]` - Re-read source, confirmed
  - `[TESTED]` - Tested in POC or script
  - `[PROVEN]` - Works in actual implementation
- **MEPI by default** - 2-3 curated options, **MCPI** when completeness needed
- **Deep beats wide** - Tokens better spent on 2-3 well-researched options than 10+ superficial ones
- **Document exclusions** - What was NOT considered and why
- **Keep ALL sources** - Even if findings were minimal

## Workflow

Make a research plan and do a step by step research about the user topic, adding sections step by step to the information document. After each section ask yourself: Do I have to verify these findings with further research? Can I remove duplicates? Can I remove unverified and contradicting findings? Is this information really helpful? If yes, why?

Always review the new section in the context of the existing ones to remove cognitive overload, redundancies, ambiguities, unverified findings.

If the research results suggest that there is no verified solution to a problem, think outside of the box: Are missing important points to see the problem or task from a different perspective? Are there clever alternatives that we are overlooking? Just don't be a super smart moron, polluting our information document with stupid and irrelevant research or non-working solutions.

At the end of the document, list all read sources with URL and the primary findings.
At the top of the document, summarize the findings as a copy / paste ready list.

**Source Retention Rule:** ALL sources (web URLs, PDFs, documents, code files) must be kept in the research output. Never discard sources - even if findings were minimal or contradictory, document what was checked to avoid re-checking.
