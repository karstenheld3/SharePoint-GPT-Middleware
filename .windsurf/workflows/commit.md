Analyze what was done since the last commit
If multiple separate activities are observed with different files touched, plan for multiple commits.
Identify the chronological order of changes by analyzing the last modified attributes of all files.
Separate into multiple commits:
- Research, specifications, plans
- Implementation
- Tests
- Documentation
Read /.windsurf/rules/git-rules.md and do one or more single line commits until all uncommitted changes are committed.
