# Agent Skill Development Rules

Rules for building agent skills that integrate external tools, MCP servers, or system capabilities.

## Target Audience

Skill files are consumed by LLMs, not humans. Optimize for:
- Medium-reasoning models
- Low context windows - every saved token = more space for the actual task
- Instruction following over prose comprehension
- ASANAPAP principle: As short as necessary, as precise as possible.

Design principles:
1. Maximum clarity - one interpretation per instruction, no ambiguity
2. Numbered steps - LLMs follow numbered sequences better than prose
3. MUST-NOT-FORGET technique - for complex skills with verification (SETUP.md, UNINSTALL.md)
4. No visual formatting in LLM-consumed files - `**bold**` adds tokens without improving comprehension
5. Headers as structure - `#` and `##` are parsing boundaries LLMs rely on
6. Compact format for lookups - one line per resource, no multi-line entries
7. Verbose format only when justified - multi-step reasoning, troubleshooting, code with explanation
8. JSON intermediate output - for multi-step workflows, require LLM to emit structured JSON between steps to enforce explicit reasoning and prevent drift

JSON intermediate output example:

```
## Step 2: Classify skill type
Emit before proceeding:
{"skill_type": "resource_lookup|instructional|setup", "format": "compact|rich|verbose", "reason": "..."}
```

This forces the LLM to commit to a decision before acting, reducing errors in medium-reasoning models.

Exception: SETUP.md and UNINSTALL.md may use richer formatting because they guide human users through system changes.

## 1. Research First

Before writing any skill documentation:

1. Understand the technology - how does it actually work?
2. Verify compatibility - does it work with the target agent (Windsurf/Cascade)?
3. Identify dependencies - what must be installed? What versions?
4. Find known issues - check GitHub issues, forums, community reports
5. Test manually first - run commands yourself before documenting them

Document research in an INFO document or the skill's SKILL.md.

## 2. Skill File Structure

Required: `SKILL.md` (see Section 2.1 for required content)
Conditional: `SETUP.md` (if install needed) + `UNINSTALL.md` (required if SETUP.md exists)
Optional: supporting docs, templates, examples

### 2.1 SKILL.md Required Content

SKILL.md MUST contain sufficient technical detail for the agent to understand and use the skill correctly:

Required sections:

1. Frontmatter - `name` and `description` fields
2. When to Use / When NOT to Use - clear applicability guidance
3. Architecture - how components connect (diagram preferred)
4. Technical Details - how the underlying technology works
5. Capabilities - what the skill enables
6. Limitations - what it cannot do, known issues
7. Sources - links to official docs, repos, research

Technical depth requirements:

- Tool actions/API - list all available actions with parameters
- Dependencies - what libraries/tools are used under the hood
- Platform specifics - OS-specific behavior (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Model requirements - which AI models work best (if applicable)
- Execution flow - how the tool operates step-by-step

Example: Insufficient vs Sufficient

```markdown
# BAD: Too vague
## Capabilities
- Can control the computer
- Takes screenshots

# GOOD: Specific and actionable
## Tool Actions
- **`screenshot`** - Capture full screen, returns base64 PNG
- **`mouse_move`** - Move cursor to (x, y) coordinates
- **`left_click`** - Single left click at current position
- **`key`** - Press key combination (e.g., `ctrl+c`)
- **`type`** - Type text string character by character

## Architecture
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent → MCP Protocol → Server → Library │
│                              └→ OS APIs │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Without sufficient technical detail, the agent cannot know which actions are available, understand parameter formats, anticipate limitations, or troubleshoot failures.

## 3. SETUP.md Requirements

SETUP.md files MUST follow this structure:

### 3.1 Pre-Installation Verification

Before modifying the system:

1. Verify all prerequisites exist (Node.js, Python, etc.)
2. Test that core functionality works in isolation
3. Check current system state (existing configs, conflicts)
4. Provide expected output for each verification step

```markdown
## Pre-Installation Verification

Complete ALL verification steps before modifying your system.
If any step fails, fix it before proceeding to installation.

## 1. Verify [Prerequisite]
[commands]
Expected: [what user should see]

## 2. Test [Core Functionality]
[commands that test WITHOUT modifying system]
Expected: [what success looks like]

## Pre-Installation Checklist
- [ ] Prerequisite 1 verified
- [ ] Prerequisite 2 verified
- [ ] Core functionality tested
- [ ] System state checked

**If all checks pass, proceed to installation.**
```

### 3.2 Installation Section

Only AFTER pre-installation verification passes:

1. Backup existing configuration
2. Make minimal changes
3. Provide rollback instructions inline
4. Show expected results after each step

### 3.2.1 MCP Config Modification Pattern (Windsurf)

For skills that modify `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`, use this PowerShell pattern:

```powershell
$configPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json"

# Define target server config
$targetServer = @{
    command = "npx"
    args = @("package-name")
}

# Read existing config (handle empty/missing)
if (Test-Path $configPath) {
    $config = Get-Content $configPath -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable
} else {
    $config = @{ mcpServers = @{} }
}

# Convert PSCustomObject to Hashtable if needed
if ($config.mcpServers -isnot [System.Collections.Hashtable]) {
    $serversHash = @{}
    $config.mcpServers.PSObject.Properties | ForEach-Object { $serversHash[$_.Name] = $_.Value }
    $config.mcpServers = $serversHash
}

# Compare current vs target (idempotent)
if ($config.mcpServers.ContainsKey("server-name")) {
    $currentJson = $config.mcpServers["server-name"] | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
    $targetJson = $targetServer | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
    if ($currentJson -eq $targetJson) {
        Write-Host "Already configured" -ForegroundColor Green
        return
    }
}

# Backup before modifying
$backupPath = "$configPath._backup_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss')"
Copy-Item $configPath $backupPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Add/update server
$config.mcpServers["server-name"] = $targetServer

# Write config
$config | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Set-Content $configPath -Encoding UTF8
```

Key requirements:
- Idempotent - running twice produces same result
- Backup first - always backup before modifying
- Handle PSCustomObject - JSON parsing returns PSCustomObject, convert to Hashtable
- Compare before write - don't modify if already correct

### 3.3 Post-Installation Verification

1. Verify installation succeeded
2. Test actual functionality
3. Document expected behavior with specific prompts
4. Provide troubleshooting for common failures

## 4. UNINSTALL.md Requirements

UNINSTALL.md files MUST follow this structure:

### 4.1 Pre-Uninstall Verification

Before removing anything:

1. Verify what is currently installed
2. Check for dependencies that might break
3. Identify all files/configs that will be affected
4. Confirm user wants to proceed

```markdown
## Pre-Uninstall Verification

## 1. Check Current Installation
[commands to show what's installed]
Expected: [what indicates it's installed]

## 2. Check Dependencies
[commands to identify what depends on this]
If dependencies found: [what to do]

## Pre-Uninstall Checklist
- [ ] Current installation verified
- [ ] Dependencies checked
- [ ] Backup created (if needed)

**If all checks pass, proceed to uninstall.**
```

### 4.2 Uninstall Section

1. Remove in reverse order of installation
2. Show what each step removes
3. Verify removal after each step

### 4.3 Post-Uninstall Verification

1. Confirm all components removed
2. Verify system returned to clean state
3. Note any manual cleanup needed

## 5. Test Before Writing

CRITICAL: Test all code snippets WITHOUT modifying the system before including them in SETUP/UNINSTALL.

### Testing Approach

1. Read-only tests first - verify state without changing it
2. Isolated tests - test functionality in temporary location
3. Destructive tests last - only after read-only tests pass

### Example Pattern

```powershell
# GOOD: Test package works before adding to config
npx -y some-mcp-server --help  # Downloads and tests, doesn't modify Windsurf

# GOOD: Check config state before modifying
$configPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json"
if (Test-Path $configPath) { Get-Content $configPath }

# BAD: Modify first, test later
Set-Content $configPath $newConfig  # Don't do this before verification
```

## 6. Documentation Quality

Every skill must include:
- Compatibility notes - what's verified vs expected to work
- Expected output - what user should see at each step
- Troubleshooting - common errors and fixes
- References - links to official docs, repos, issues

Avoid:
- Untested commands
- Vague success criteria ("it should work")
- Missing error handling
- Assumptions about user's system state

## 7. Case Study: computer-use-mcp Skill

Example of applying these rules when building the `computer-use-mcp` skill:

### 7.1 Research Phase

1. Web search - found domdomegg/computer-use-mcp repository
2. Read documentation - GitHub README, nut.js docs, Anthropic Computer Use docs
3. Identify compatibility gap - repo lists Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline but NOT Windsurf
4. Document finding - added compatibility note: "expected to work but not officially verified"

### 7.2 Initial SETUP.md (What We Did Wrong)

First version jumped straight to installation:
```markdown
## 1. Configure MCP Server
Add to config...  # BAD: No verification first
```

### 7.3 Critique and Fix

Devil's Advocate review identified:
- No pre-installation verification
- Untested assumption that it works with Windsurf
- No nut.js dependency testing
- Vague test instructions

Fixed by adding:
- Section 1-6: pre-installation verification (Node.js, npx, package test, nut.js test, screenshot test, config check)
- Pre-Installation Checklist: all checks must pass before proceeding
- Separator: clear `---` line between verification and installation
- Section 7+: installation only after verification passes
- Expected output: specific prompts and what success looks like

### 7.4 SKILL.md Enhancement

Initial version was minimal. Enhanced with:
- Technical architecture diagram
- All tool actions with parameters
- nut.js API examples
- Model requirements
- Execution cycle explanation
- 7 verified source links

### 7.5 Lessons Learned

1. Research before writing - found compatibility gap early
2. Test commands first - `npx -y computer-use-mcp --help` before documenting
3. Verify then modify - pre-installation checks prevent broken installs
4. Expected output is crucial - user knows if something went wrong
5. Sources matter - link to primary documentation

## 8. Token Optimization for Skill Files

Skills are consumed by LLMs, not humans. Every token costs money and context window space. Reduce tokens without sacrificing clarity or instruction detail.

### 8.1 Core Principle

Never sacrifice clarity for brevity. But never add formatting that only helps human eyes.

### 8.2 What to Remove

Visual-only formatting (LLMs don't benefit):
- `**Bold**` markup - LLMs parse plain text equally well
- `- ` bullet prefixes when plain lines under a heading are unambiguous
- `### ` sub-sub-headers when a simple label on the line suffices
- Blank lines between every item in a list
- Verbose prefixes like `- **URL:** `, `- **Best for:** ` when a compact format works

Redundant prose:
- "When to Use This File" sections that repeat the Keywords line
- Descriptions that restate the heading ("Flight tracking" under `## Flights`)
- Filler phrases: "This section covers", "The following resources"

### 8.3 What to Keep

Always keep (improves LLM comprehension):
- `# ` and `## ` headers (structural parsing boundaries)
- Keywords/trigger lines (how the LLM finds the right file)
- Parenthetical notes with critical context: `(blocks bots, use browser)`
- Concrete examples: `Frankfurt flight delays -> DE.md -> Flightradar24`
- All URLs, parameters, and technical detail

### 8.4 Compact Format for Resource/Lookup Skills

For skills that are primarily URL/resource lookups:

```
# Title
Keywords: term1, term2, term3

## Category
Name: https://url.com (notes if needed)
Name2: https://url2.com
```

One line per resource. No bullets, no bold, no multi-line entries.

### 8.5 When Verbose Format is Justified

Use richer formatting when:
- Instructions require multi-step reasoning (SETUP.md, UNINSTALL.md)
- Parameters have complex interactions
- Failure modes need detailed troubleshooting
- Code snippets need surrounding explanation

### 8.6 Review Metric

After writing a skill file, ask: "If I remove this token, does the LLM lose information or context?" If no, remove it.

## 9. Skill Review Checklist
