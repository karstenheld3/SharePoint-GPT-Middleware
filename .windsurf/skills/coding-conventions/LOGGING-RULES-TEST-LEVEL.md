# Test-Level Logging Rules

Rules for test output used by Quality Assurance (QA) to verify correctness.

## Philosophy

**Goal: All failure information must be in the logs.**

A QA engineer should understand what failed and why without analyzing additional files, databases, or external data sources. The log output alone must be sufficient to diagnose the problem.

**This goal drives all rules in this document:**
- No timestamps for deterministic output (LOG-TS-01)
- Clear section structure (LOG-TS-02)
- Test case IDs for traceability (LOG-TS-03)
- Explicit status markers (LOG-TS-04)
- Consistent status patterns (LOG-TS-05)
- Detailed output for debugging (LOG-TS-06)
- Summary with pass/fail counts (LOG-TS-07)

- `LOGGING-RULES-USER-FACING.md` - User-facing rules (LOG-UF-01 to LOG-UF-06)
- `LOGGING-RULES-APP-LEVEL.md` - App-level rules (LOG-AP-01 to LOG-AP-05)

## Rules

### LOG-TS-01: No Timestamps

Test output must be deterministic for diff comparison. Timestamps add noise and break comparisons.

**Rationale:** Test output should be identical across runs if the code hasn't changed. Timestamps make every run different.

*BAD*:
```
[10:15:23] Running test_user_creation...
[10:15:24] PASSED
2026-03-04 10:15:25.456 Test completed
```

*GOOD*:
```
Running test_user_creation...
  OK.
Test completed.
```

**Exception:** Selftest endpoints that stream to users may include timestamps for progress indication, but the test logic itself should not depend on them.

### LOG-TS-02: Section Structure

Use visual separators to group related tests.

**Section header:** `========== Title ==========` (10 equals signs each side)

**Phase header:** `===== Phase N: Name =====` (5 equals signs each side)

**Rationale:** Visual separators make it easy to scan output and find specific sections.

*BAD*:
```
--- Tests ---
Test 1
Test 2
=== More Tests ===
Test 3
```

*GOOD*:
```
========== User Authentication Tests ==========
Verifying login, logout, and session management.

[ 1 / 3 ] TC-01: Login with valid credentials...
  OK.
[ 2 / 3 ] TC-02: Login with invalid password...
  OK. Correctly rejected.
[ 3 / 3 ] TC-03: Session timeout after inactivity...
  OK.

========== Database Connection Tests ==========
Testing connection pooling and error recovery.

[ 1 / 2 ] TC-04: Connect with valid credentials...
  OK.
[ 2 / 2 ] TC-05: Handle connection timeout...
  OK. Retry succeeded.
```

**With phases:**
```
===== Phase 1: Configuration =====
[ 1 / 25 ] M1: Config validation - site URL...
  OK. site_url='https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SelftestSite'
[ 2 / 25 ] M2: Config validation - certificate path...
  OK. cert_path='E:\certs\app.pfx'

===== Phase 2: Connection =====
[ 3 / 25 ] M3: Connect to SharePoint site...
  OK. Connected as 'app@contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
```

### LOG-TS-03: Test Case IDs

Use prefix format for traceability: `TC-01:`, `M1:`, etc.

**Rationale:** IDs enable referencing specific tests in bug reports, documentation, and discussions.

*BAD*:
```
Testing login...
Testing logout...
Testing session...
```

*GOOD*:
```
[ 1 / 9 ] TC-01: Creating test site 'selftest_a1b2c3d4'...
[ 2 / 9 ] TC-02: Getting test site...
[ 3 / 9 ] TC-03: Updating test site...
```

**Alternative formats:**
```
[ 1 / 25 ] M1: Config validation...
[ 5 / 11 ] TC-05: Process library items...
[ 7 / 25 ] M7: Full crawl...
```

### LOG-TS-04: Status Markers

Use explicit markers for comparison and assertion results.

**Comparison:** `[equal]`, `[different]`

```
  [equal] Row count  Expected=14  Actual=14
  [different] Column count  Expected=5  Actual=4
  [equal] File size  Expected=1024  Actual=1024
```

**Assertion:** `[ok]`, `[fail]`

```
  [ok] All required fields present
  [fail] Missing 'created_date' column
  [ok] Data types match expected schema
```

**Rationale:** Explicit markers enable grep/search for failures and make status immediately visible.

### LOG-TS-05: Status Patterns

Use consistent status keyword patterns.

**Success:**
```
  OK.
  OK. 12 members resolved.
  OK. site_url='https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SelftestSite'
```

**Failure:**
```
  FAIL: Delete failed: {'ok': False, 'error': 'Site not found'}
  FAIL: Validation failed -> Expected 5, got 4
  FAIL: context -> error details
```

**Warning:**
```
  WARNING: 2 items skipped due to missing data.
  WARNING: Using fallback configuration.
```

**Expected failure:**
```
  EXPECTED FAIL: (401) Unauthorized
  EXPECTED FAIL: (404) Site not found
```

**Skip:**
```
  SKIP: Test requires database connection.
  SKIP: Feature not enabled in test environment.
```

**Rationale:** Consistent patterns enable automated parsing and reporting.

### LOG-TS-06: Output Details

Provide enough detail to understand failures without additional investigation.

**Item lists with references:**
```
  3 items missing from output:
    Line 8: 'user_alpha@example.com'
    Line 15: 'user_beta@example.com'
    Line 22: 'user_gamma@example.com'
```

**Comparison details:**
```
  [different] Column 'date_created' format
    Expected: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    Actual: 'MM/DD/YYYY'
    Line 1: '03/04/2026' should be '2026-03-04'
```

**Row/column counts:**
```
  Comparing CSV files...
    [equal] Row count: 523
    [different] Column count: Expected=8, Actual=7
    Missing column: 'last_modified'
```

**Rationale:** Self-contained details eliminate need to examine source files or databases.

### LOG-TS-07: Summary and Result

Always end with a summary showing counts and final result.

**Summary format:**
```
OK: X, FAIL: Y
OK: X, EXPECTED FAIL: Y, FAIL: Z
```

**Final result:**
```
RESULT: PASSED
RESULT: PASSED WITH WARNINGS
RESULT: FAILED
```

**Complete summary block:**
```
===== SELFTEST COMPLETE =====
OK: 10, EXPECTED FAIL: 1, FAIL: 0
Test execution completed.
END: sites_security_scan_selftest() (12.0 secs).
```

**Extended summary:**
```
========== Test Summary ==========
15 tests executed
OK: 12 passed
WARNING: 2 skipped
FAIL: 1 failed
Duration: 4.2s
RESULT: FAILED
```
