# Session Progress

**Doc ID**: YYYY-MM-DD_[SessionTopicCamelCase]-PROGRESS

Track implementation progress and decisions.

## To Do

- [ ] AUTH-PR-001: Implement token refresh mutex to prevent race conditions
- [ ] API-PR-002: Add server time synchronization for expiration checks
- [ ] Update API client error handling to distinguish 401 types
- [ ] Write unit tests for token refresh logic
- [ ] API-PR-004: Implement exponential backoff retry (deferred to future session)

## In Progress

- [ ] AUTH-PR-003: Migrate refresh token storage from localStorage to httpOnly cookies

## Done

- [x] Analyzed current token refresh implementation
- [x] Identified race condition in concurrent refresh scenario (AUTH-PR-001)
- [x] Researched secure token storage options
- [x] Created AUTH-SP01 specification for token refresh improvements

## Tried But Not Used

- Client-side token refresh queue with Promise deduplication
  - Reason: Too complex, mutex pattern is simpler and more reliable
- JWT expiration extension via sliding window
  - Reason: Server doesn't support sliding sessions, requires backend changes

## Test Coverage

- [x] Unit tests for token expiration calculation
- [ ] Integration tests for concurrent refresh scenario
- [ ] Manual verification of token refresh flow with network throttling
